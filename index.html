        <h3>About Brian</h3>
        <p>After graduating high school I briefly attended community college in southern Virginia. After deciding secondary education wasn't my route at the time I started working restaurant jobs. I did that for a number of years before getting into automotive sales. I saw success in the field but found the long hours and aggressive approach to sales in the industry were making me a rather cynical 22 year old.</p>
        <P>I chose to return to the restaurant industry and went on to work in some of the nicer restaurants throughout Northern Virginia and DC. I did fine dining for years and eventually met my wife. The late nights and fast paced lifestyle was fun for my 20's but I decided to settle down and bartend a local family restuarant.</P>
        <p>After marriage and having our first child my life got turned upside down(like so many others) by the pandemic. I decided to pursue a new career path and at the recomendation of a friend I chose the bloc thinkful web deveolpment program. I am excited to further my education down this exciting path and look forward to the doors this program will open</p>
